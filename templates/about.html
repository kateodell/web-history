    <h1>About this project</h1>

    <h3>What does this project do?</h3>
        <p>
            The Web History project gives an insight into how various HTML tags have been used over the years. For example, which tags have grown in popularity over time? Which deprecated tags do people refuse to stop using?
        </p> 
    <h3>Where does this data come from?</h3>   
        <p>
            This project analyzes and aggregates archived versions of websites from the <a href="http://www.archive.org">Internet Archive's</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a>. Data from the home pages of over 450 sites have been included in this analysis. These sites skew toward the most popular and most visited sites on the internet, as historical Alexa rankings were a source in selecting the sites to include.  More sites will be included in the future.
        </p>
    <h3>Who created this?</h3>
        <p>
            I worked at the Internet Archive for several years, helping archive websites. I wanted to create something that uncovered and presented something interesting about how web technology has changed over the years.

            I started this project as my "final project" at <a href="http://www.hackbrightacademy.com"> Hackbright Academy</a> in August 2013. You can check out more technical details and plans for the future on GitHub: <a href='https://github.com/kateodell/web-history'>github.com/kateodell/web-history</a>
